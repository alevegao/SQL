#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 --How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
Used where clause to clean data of incorrect order id's, those containing more than 6 digits AND
those just containing "Order ID"

#2 --How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*), Product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3 --Customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4 --Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5 --What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6 --Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold,
-- and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, location, SUM(quantity) AS numProducts,
SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 --How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity * price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers ON 
customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity >= 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8 --List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), location, orderdate
